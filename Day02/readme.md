optimized code 
comment :remove , if space also remove that 
some code are like where we don't use all portion of react and react-dom



Bundler:
        webpack , vite, parcel

        how to install parcel???

what is npm ??
node package manager ?? 
   everything like parcel , typescript , react, react, reactdom are present in npm 
   so that we can directly use in our project without writing the same code again and again 

   it's like database where javascript functions are stores for the future use , if anyone wants they can just pick the needfull one and its' done
